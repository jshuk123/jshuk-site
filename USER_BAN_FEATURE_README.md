# User Ban Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to ban users from the platform for violations of terms of service or other policy violations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `is_banned` field to users table
- Added `banned_at` timestamp field
- Added `ban_reason` text field for storing ban reasons
- Added `is_active` field (for compatibility with existing admin panel)
- Added `suspended_at` field for tracking suspensions
- Added database indexes for performance

### 2. Admin Panel Features
- **Ban User Button**: Admins can ban users with optional reason
- **Unban User Button**: Admins can unban previously banned users
- **Ban Status Display**: Shows ban status and reason in user list
- **Ban Modals**: Confirmation dialogs with reason input
- **Admin Logging**: All ban/unban actions are logged

### 3. Security Features
- **Login Protection**: Banned users cannot log in
- **Session Protection**: Banned users are redirected to banned page
- **Admin Protection**: Admins cannot ban themselves
- **CSRF Protection**: All ban actions use POST requests

### 4. User Experience
- **Banned Page**: User-friendly page explaining the ban
- **Support Contact**: Easy way for banned users to contact support
- **Ban Reason Display**: Users can see why they were banned

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Navigate to: `http://yourdomain.com/scripts/run_ban_migration.php`
2. This will add all necessary database fields
3. Verify the migration completed successfully

### Step 2: Test the Feature
1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to Admin Panel → Users
3. Find a test user and click the "Ban" button
4. Enter a reason and confirm the ban
5. Try logging in as the banned user - they should be blocked

## Usage Instructions

### Banning a User
1. Go to Admin Panel → Users
2. Find the user you want to ban
3. Click the "Ban" button (red button with user-slash icon)
4. Enter an optional reason for the ban
5. Click "Ban User" to confirm

### Unbanning a User
1. Go to Admin Panel → Users
2. Find the banned user (they will show "Banned" status)
3. Click the "Unban" button (green button with user-check icon)
4. Confirm the unban action

### Viewing Ban Information
- Ban status is displayed in the "Ban Status" column
- Ban reasons are shown below the status badge
- Detailed ban information is available in the user view page

## File Structure

```
admin/
├── actions/
│   ├── ban_user.php          # Handles user banning
│   └── unban_user.php        # Handles user unbanning
├── users(1).php              # Updated user management page
└── view_user.php             # Updated to show ban info

auth/
└── login.php                 # Updated to check ban status

includes/
└── security.php              # Added ban check functions

sql/
└── add_user_ban_feature.sql  # Database migration

scripts/
└── run_ban_migration.php     # Migration runner

banned.php                    # Banned user page
```

## Security Considerations

### Admin Protection
- Admins cannot ban themselves
- All ban actions require admin privileges
- Ban actions are logged with admin ID and IP address

### User Protection
- Banned users cannot access any protected pages
- Ban status is checked on login and session validation
- Users are redirected to a user-friendly banned page

### Data Integrity
- Ban actions are atomic database operations
- All ban-related fields are properly indexed
- Foreign key constraints are maintained

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
If the migration fails:
1. Check database permissions
2. Verify the SQL file exists
3. Run the migration manually in phpMyAdmin

### Ban Not Working
1. Verify the migration ran successfully
2. Check that the `is_banned` field exists in the users table
3. Ensure the admin has proper permissions

### User Can Still Access Site
1. Check if the user is actually banned in the database
2. Verify the login.php file was updated
3. Clear user sessions if needed

## Support

For issues with the ban feature:
1. Check the admin logs for ban actions
2. Verify database field existence
3. Test with a fresh user account

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Temporary bans with automatic expiration
- Ban appeal system
- Email notifications for bans
- Bulk ban/unban operations
- Ban history tracking
