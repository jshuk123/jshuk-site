# Recruitment Page Fix

## Issue Description
The recruitment page at `https://jshuk.com/recruitment.php` was showing "Unable to load job listings. Please try again later." due to a missing database column.

## Root Cause
The `recruitment` table in the database was missing the `is_featured` column that the PHP code was trying to use. This caused a database error when the page tried to query for featured jobs.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Run the PHP Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
php scripts/fix_recruitment_system.php
```

### Option 2: Run SQL Scripts Manually
1. Run `sql/fix_recruitment_complete.sql` in your database
2. Or run `sql/add_recruitment_featured_column.sql` for just the column fix

### Option 3: Manual Database Fix
If you have database access, run this SQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `recruitment` 
ADD COLUMN `is_featured` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
AFTER `is_active`;
```

## What the Fix Does

1. **Adds Missing Column**: Adds the `is_featured` column to the recruitment table
2. **Adds Performance Indexes**: Improves query performance for filtering and sorting
3. **Ensures Data Integrity**: Makes sure job sectors exist and featured jobs are available
4. **Tests Functionality**: Verifies that the recruitment queries work properly

## Verification

After running the fix, you can verify it worked by:

1. Visiting `https://jshuk.com/recruitment.php`
2. The page should load without the error message
3. Job listings should display properly
4. Featured job section should work (if jobs exist)

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues after running the fix:

1. **Check Database Connection**: Ensure your database credentials are correct
2. **Check Error Logs**: Look in `logs/php_errors.log` for specific error messages
3. **Clear Cache**: Clear your browser cache and try again
4. **Run Diagnostics**: Use `scripts/check_recruitment_issues.php` to diagnose problems

## Database Requirements

The fix requires these tables to exist:
- `recruitment` (main jobs table)
- `job_sectors` (job categories)
- `businesses` (employer information)
- `business_images` (company logos)
- `users` (user information)

## Performance Improvements

The fix also adds these performance indexes:
- `idx_featured_active` - For filtering featured jobs
- `idx_created_at` - For sorting by date
- `idx_sector_active` - For sector filtering
- `idx_location_active` - For location filtering
- `idx_job_type_active` - For job type filtering

## Support

If you continue to have issues after applying this fix, please:
1. Check the error logs in `logs/php_errors.log`
2. Run the diagnostic script: `php scripts/check_recruitment_issues.php`
3. Ensure your database connection is working properly
